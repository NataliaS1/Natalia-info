I like to draw, paint, lift weights, watch sci-fi, and play video games.  I used to draw a lot of manga,
but now I draw landscapes and realistic portraits.  My favorite games at the moment are Vampire:  The Masquerade and the Witcher 3.
My favorite subjects are website development, animation, and English.
